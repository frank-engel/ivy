    disk.

    This class is intended to be used to store simple settings that need to be
     retained between session of the subject
    application, such as, last folder opened, or units setting. Any setting
    that the application needs to know
    when it is run again can be stored using the methods in this class.

    Data are stored a dictionary which is then written to a json file having
    the filename provided by the user and
    stored in the folder defined by the APPDATA environment variable.

    Note
    ----
    The os and json packages are required for this class.

    Attributes
    ----------
    settings_file : str

    settings: dict
        Dictionary used to store user defined settings.
