# Raspberry Pi specific requirements for IVyTools
# Optimized for Raspberry Pi 4 and Raspberry Pi 5

# Raspberry Pi optimizations and notes:
#
# 1. Install system dependencies first:
#    sudo apt-get update
#    sudo apt-get install -y python3-dev python3-pip python3-venv
#    sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg libavcodec-extra libopencv-dev
#    sudo apt-get install -y libatlas-base-dev  # For NumPy/SciPy performance
#
# 2. Some packages may need to be built from source on ARM64:
#    - This can take 10-30 minutes on Raspberry Pi 4
#    - Raspberry Pi 5 is significantly faster
#
# 3. Memory considerations:
#    - Raspberry Pi 4 4GB: Can process 1080p videos
#    - Raspberry Pi 4 8GB: Recommended for larger videos
#    - Consider using swap space for large videos
#
# 4. Performance tuning:
#    - Use lower resolution videos when possible
#    - Process videos in batches overnight
#    - Consider using external SSD for faster I/O
#
# 5. Optional: Install pre-built wheels for faster installation
#    pip3 install --upgrade pip
#    pip3 install --prefer-binary -r requirements-rpi.txt
