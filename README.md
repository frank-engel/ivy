# <img src="image_velocimetry_tools/gui/icons/IVy_Logo.svg"  width="120" height="120">Image Velocimetry Tools (IVy Tools)

The IVyTools is a Python application which provides an end-to-end workflow 
support for the processing of video and imagery into water velocity and 
streamflow measurements. IVyTools uses Space-Time Image Velocimetry to 
compute water surface velocity from sequences of images.

## Installation

1. IVyTools will be available to USGS users through WFAST to 
   registered computers. Internal USGS users with computers not registered in 
   WFAST can download the software from the IVyTools repository at the link 
   in the table above.
2. No installation is required to use the software, however the LAVFilters 
   codec is required to enable video playback. See the Installation 
   instructions in the Release Notes for more information.
3. To run the application, extract the contents from the downloaded `.zip` file 
   into a folder of the user's choice.
4. The `.zip` file includes a user guide that contains detailed instructions on 
   IVyTools's features and an executable to run the application.
