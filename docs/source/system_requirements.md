# System Requirements

The Image Velocimetry Tools application, or **IVyTools**, is essentially
a video processing tool. As such, some system hardware requirements must
be considered when using **IVyTools**.

## Minimum Hardware

-   Intel i5 processor or equivalent

-   4GB memory

-   6 GB free space (the program is ~300 mb, but during run time, a swap
    file is created that can be very large)

-   Intel integrated graphics (e.g., Intel HD 620 or equivalent)

## Recommended Hardware

-   Intel i7 or better. **IVyTools** will leverage multi-core
    processing, so having at least 8 cores can significantly increase
    processing speed.

-   32GB or more memory

-   20 GB or more disk free space

-   Although **IVyTools** does not use GPU processing at this time, a
    decent graphics card can help
