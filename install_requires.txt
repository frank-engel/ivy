# Install requirements for image_velocimetry_tools
# This file uses relaxed version constraints suitable for PyPI distribution
# For exact reproducible environment, see requirements.txt
#
# NOTE: Runtime dependencies only. Dev tools (pytest, sphinx, black, etc.)
# are NOT included here - install separately if needed for development.

# Core scientific computing
# Note: numpy 1.26.x versions are compatible; relaxed to avoid conflicts with numba
numpy>=1.26.2,<1.27.0
pandas==1.4.0
scipy==1.10.0
matplotlib==3.6.3

# Image processing
opencv-python-headless
pillow
imageio
imutils
# qimage2ndarray>=1.9.0,<2.0  # GUI only, moved to extras_require['gui']

# Machine learning (for STIV)
# Note: We explicitly pin numba 0.58.x to work around areacomp3 JIT compilation issues
# areacomp3 declares numba~=0.61.0, but that version has stricter JIT rules that fail
# with areacomp3's @numba.jit decorated methods. Pip will install our version (0.58.x)
# and show dependency conflict warnings - these are expected and can be ignored.
numba
scikit-image

# GUI (moved to extras_require['gui'] in setup.py)
# PyQt5>=5.15.6,<6.0
# Note: PyQt5 is now optional. Install with: pip install image_velocimetry_tools[gui]

# Video processing
# Note: ffmpeg binary must be installed separately and available in PATH
# or in ./bin/ directory. No Python package required.
